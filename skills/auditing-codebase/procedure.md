## Procedure

You MUST use TodoWrite to create a task for EACH of the steps below and complete
them in order. Do not skip steps.

### Step 0 — Resolve target

1. If user supplied a path (positional arg or `--target=`), use it. Confirm the
   path exists and resolve to a `{module}` name (the basename).
2. If no target was supplied, list candidate crates/modules under `crates/` or
   `src/` and ask the user to pick one, several, or `all`. If `all`, process
   each module sequentially (one branch per module, repeating Steps 0–6). Stop
   on the first module whose verification gate fails and surface it to the user.
3. Do NOT proceed to Step 1 until the target is confirmed.

### Step 1 — Load configuration and present the plan for approval

This step does NOT create a branch. Its only output is a confirmation card
that the user approves (or adjusts) before anything else happens.

1. Read `docs/audits/audit-config.yaml` if present. If missing, use the
   defaults shown in the Configuration section above.
2. Resolve effective values: CLI flags > config file > defaults.
3. Determine `N = --auditors` (default 3, clamped to 1–4) and pick the first
   N entries from `auditors`. Assign labels `a, b, c, d` in order.

4. **Verify model availability** — hard requirement before showing the card.

   Run:
   ```bash
   pi --list-models 2>&1
   ```
   This lists every model the user actually has available (authenticated
   providers only). It is the source of truth — NOT the built-in catalog.

   For each configured auditor and the judge, check that its ID appears
   verbatim in the second column of that output:
   ```bash
   pi --list-models 2>&1 | awk '{print $2}' | grep -Fx "<model-id>"
   ```

   Build two lists:
   - `available` — IDs that matched exactly
   - `missing`   — IDs that did not match

   For each missing ID, search for the bare model name anywhere in the
   output to find the closest available alternative.

5. **Present the confirmation card.** Show this exact format, filling in
   real values. Mark missing models with ✘ and available ones with ✔.

   ```

   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

   Then ask:
   > “Does this look right? You can adjust before we start:
   > - Change the **lens** (e.g. `improve-codebase-architecture`, `rust-perf`)
   > - Swap or replace a **model** (use the exact ID from `pi --list-models`)
   > - Change the **number of auditors** (1–4)
   >
   > Type **go** to start, or tell me what to change.”

6. **Wait for the user’s response.** Handle each case:

   - **“go” / “yes” / “start” / “ok”**: proceed to Step 2.
   - **Any missing models (✘) and user has not addressed them**: do NOT
     proceed. Remind the user that missing models must be resolved first.
   - **User changes a model**: update the effective config in memory,
     re-run the availability check for the new ID, update the card,
     show it again. Repeat until all models are ✔ and user says go.
   - **User changes the lens**: update effective config in memory,
     show the updated card, ask again.
   - **User changes N**: re-pick the first N auditors from the list,
     show the updated card, ask again.
   - **User says no / cancel**: stop entirely. No branch created.

   Do NOT proceed to Step 2 while any auditor or judge has ✘ status.

### Step 2 — Create dedicated branch

```bash
git checkout -b audit/{module}-{YYYY-MM-DD}
```
If the branch already exists, append a `-N` suffix (`-2`, `-3`, ...) until unique.
Never overwrite an existing audit branch.

### Step 3 — Parallel auditing (RED of the audit cycle)

1. For each auditor `i ∈ [0, N)`:
   - Read `skills/auditing-codebase/auditor-prompt-template.md` and substitute
     `{{TARGET}}`, `{{MODULE_NAME}}`, `{{LABEL}}` (= `a`/`b`/`c`/`d`),
     `{{LENS_SKILL}}`, `{{BRANCH}}`.
   - Dispatch via `Agent` with `subagent_type: general-purpose`,
     `model: <auditor_i>`, `run_in_background: true`, and the interpolated
     prompt.
   - Record the returned agent ID.
2. Wait for ALL agent IDs using `get_subagent_result(wait: true)` for each.
3. For each auditor:
   - Success = the file `docs/audits/{module}-{label}.md` exists, is non-empty,
     AND contains at least one `## ` heading. Failures are recorded with the
     reason (timeout, error message, empty output, missing file).
4. Build `successful_auditors` = list of labels whose file is good.
5. **Failure tolerance gate:**
   - If `len(successful_auditors) == 0`: ABORT. Tell the user and stop. The
     branch stays so the user can inspect any partial output.
   - Else: continue with survivors. Note all failures — they go in
     `Executive Summary → Failed auditors`.
6. Commit:
   ```bash
   git add docs/audits/
   git commit -m "audit: add raw audit reports for {module}"
   ```

### Step 4 — Peer-ranking (Stage 1.5)

Skip this step entirely if `len(successful_auditors) < 2` (no peers to rank).
In that case, set `aggregate_ranking = []` and continue to Step 5.

1. Read `skills/auditing-codebase/peer-ranking-prompt-template.md`.
2. Build `{{REPORTS_BLOCK}}` by concatenating every successful auditor's file
   content, prefixed by `## auditor_<label>` headings and `---` separators
   (exact format documented in the template).
3. Build `{{VALID_LABELS}}` = comma-separated `auditor_<label>` for each
   successful auditor.
4. For each successful auditor, dispatch a fresh subagent with that auditor's
   model and the interpolated peer-ranking prompt. Run them in parallel with
   `run_in_background: true`.
5. Parse each response by finding `FINAL RANKING:` and extracting the numbered
   `auditor_<label>` lines. Discard a ranking if it omits any valid label or
   includes an unknown one.
6. Compute aggregate ranking: for each label, average its position across all
   valid rankings (1-indexed). Lower = better. Build
   `{{AGGREGATE_RANKING_TABLE}}` (markdown table: Label | Average rank | Vote
   count).

### Step 5 — Judge consolidation

1. Read `skills/auditing-codebase/judge-prompt-template.md`.
2. Interpolate all placeholders EXCEPT `{{LABEL_TO_MODEL_TABLE}}` (the judge
   does not see model names). Use `{{TOTAL_COST}}` = the running sum of
   subagent costs reported so far, or `unknown` if not available.
3. Dispatch the judge subagent with `model: <judge>`. NOT in background — wait
   inline; this is the critical synthesis step.
4. Verify the judge produced `docs/audits/{module}-consolidated.md` with the
   required headings (`## Executive Summary`, `## Quick Wins`,
   `## Confirmed Findings`, `## Appendix A`, `## Appendix B`, `## Appendix C`).
   If any required section is missing, treat as judge failure: surface to user,
   leave the raw reports in place, and stop.
5. Append `## Appendix D — Label → Model mapping` to the consolidated file with
   the mapping built from `successful_auditors` + `judge`. Format:
   ```markdown
   ## Appendix D — Label → Model mapping (traceability)
   - auditor_a → sonnet
   - auditor_b → opus
   - auditor_c → gpt-5
   - judge → opus
   ```
6. Commit:
   ```bash
   git add docs/audits/{module}-consolidated.md
   git commit -m "audit: add consolidated findings for {module}"
   ```

### Step 6 — User review gate

Tell the user:
> Consolidated report saved to `docs/audits/{module}-consolidated.md`. Please
> review it (edit findings, demote severity, or remove items you reject) and
> let me know when ready to generate the TODO list.

Wait for the user's go-ahead. If they edit the file before answering, that is
fine — the next step reads from disk.

### Step 7 — TODO list

Read `docs/audits/{module}-consolidated.md` and generate
`docs/audits/{module}-todos.md` directly — do NOT invoke `writing-plans`.
The consolidated report already contains all the prioritization information
needed; a full plan would be redundant and expensive.

Write `docs/audits/{module}-todos.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# TODOs: {module}
Generated from: docs/audits/{module}-consolidated.md
Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}

## Quick Wins
- [ ] [QW-001] <title> — `path:Lx-Ly` — <one-line action>
- [ ] [QW-002] ...

## Critical
- [ ] [F-001] <title> — `path:Lx-Ly` — <one-line action>

## High
- [ ] [F-002] ...

## Medium
- [ ] ...

## Low
- [ ] ...

## Disputed (needs human decision before acting)
- [ ] [D-001] <summary of disagreement>
```

Rules for generating the TODO list:
- One checkbox per Confirmed finding from the consolidated report.
- Order: Quick Wins first, then Critical → High → Medium → Low.
- Within a bucket: small effort before large effort.
- Each line: `- [ ] [ID] <title> — \`file:Lx-Ly\` — <one-line action>`.
- Disputed items get their own section at the bottom — do not mix with Confirmed.
- Do NOT include False positives or Out-of-scope items.

After writing the file, commit:
```bash
git add docs/audits/{module}-todos.md
git commit -m "audit: add TODO list for {module}"
```

### Step 8 — Implementation

Invoke the `subagent-driven-development` skill with
`docs/audits/{module}-todos.md` as the task list. Each checkbox becomes its
own subagent and its own commit, per that skill's discipline. Do NOT
inline-execute.

### Step 9 — Verification gate (HARD GATE)

1. For each command in `config.verification.must_pass`, run it from the repo
   root. Capture stdout, stderr, and exit code.
2. ALL commands must exit 0. Default commands:
   ```
   cargo build --workspace --all-targets
   cargo test --workspace --all-features
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   ```
3. **If any command fails:**
   - STOP. Do NOT commit anything new. Do NOT attempt repair. Do NOT roll back.
   - Report to the user:
     - which command failed (verbatim)
     - the last ~50 lines of its output
     - `git diff <branch-base>..HEAD --stat` so they see what was changed
   - Hand control to the user.
4. **If every command passes:**
   - Write a verification report at `docs/audits/{module}-verification.md` with
     the command list, exit codes, and a short tail of each output.
   - Commit:
     ```bash
     git add docs/audits/{module}-verification.md
     git commit -m "audit: verification passed for {module}"
     ```
   - Tell the user: audit complete on branch `audit/{module}-{YYYY-MM-DD}`,
     merge or discard at will.
